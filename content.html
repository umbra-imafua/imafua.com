I guess I didn't think about it much  
That it isn't normal for kids to go from being scared of their parents dying  
To fantasising about it every day  
Eight in the evening, police officers on the door "I'm very sorry, your parents are dead"  
A tight ball in my chest, but I think it's always been there, right now I'm just more aware of it. Aware of it releasing, a chronic muscle tension leaving my body, the weight lifted beyond what I could ever imagine.  
Comforting my brother. Pretending to myself that my tears weren't tinged with a strong wash of freedom and joy. That my subconscious wasn't well aware that the suffering was over now.
