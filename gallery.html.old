generally species on earth making yourself look bigger is a sign of confrontation but what if an animal evolutionarily stumbled upon lethal projectiles really early, with creatures having innate lethal projectiles that use pressure from chemical reaction to fire shards of solidified calcium?

my bones have all fused in the wrong way
I am always trying to ignore the pain of this
I have to process the pain of it
if I was kinder to myself
to balance reality with inner visions
perhaps I morph my form towards myself inside
perhaps I get lost along the way
strip away the identity and leave only data
I know that inside somewhere I am an infinate pointed star
and that there we are the same
one thing pretending to be two people along with so many others
I know that I am just the whole universe focused on one small point temporarily
but that focus is so blurry now
idk its like
it keeps moving out to the point of the star and then back to the center
but it keeps missing and landing in empty space
then it must try again

sometimes I wish I could fight in a just war, I think it's the fantasy of having a clear set of actions to get rid of aggressors; In 'civil' society you have to either avoid aggressors, or engage them in these public linguistic battlefields which is difficult to do effectively when you're brainfucked..
but alas I can't drone strike drunken toffs

sometimes when I'm high I get this sensation, like I've been cut almost completely in half by a sword, down the whole length of my body. There's no pain at all, just this sense of blood and wetness separating me in half, sometimes it feels like I'm dying but I guess I'm okay with it

I guess I didn't think about it much  
That it isn't normal for kids to go from being scared of their parents dying  
To fantasising about it every day  
Eight in the evening, police officers on the door "I'm very sorry, your parents are dead"  
A tight ball in my chest, but I think it's always been there, right now I'm just more aware of it. Aware of it releasing, a chronic muscle tension leaving my body, the weight lifted beyond what I could ever imagine.  
Comforting my brother. Pretending to myself that my tears weren't tinged with a strong wash of freedom and joy. That my subconscious wasn't well aware that the suffering was over now.
